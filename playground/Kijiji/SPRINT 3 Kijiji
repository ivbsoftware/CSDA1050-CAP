SPRINT 3 Kijiji
==============================
1. What I have done so far:
  1)   scrapyjiji.py   is the scraper, modified a little, dropped the useless notification function
  2)   main.py   in this code, I called the scraper and pass over the parameters, to create txt files.  
       Including:  
                      kijiji_GTA.txt (any types of rental AD in GTA);
                      kijiji_GTA_basement.txt  (basement rental AD in GTA);
                      kijiji_GTA_apt.txt       (apartment)
                      kijiji_GTA_house.txt   (house)
                      kijiji_GTA_one_bed.txt    (one bed room)
                      kijiji_GTA_two_bed.txt     (two bed room)
  3)  Convert_CSV.py  I converted the text files into csv files with new separators (&=), removed empty lines (\n), add rent unite type as a new column ;
  4)  append_data.py  This program read all the csv files, append them into a big df, then dropped the duplicates based on first column (AD_ID), then save into a new csv: data_all_test;
  5)  Kijiji-Scraper_s.py  I modified the original scraper, rewrote the "ParseAd" part so it can scrape data from single web pages.
  6)  Main_scr_all_pages.py I wrote a loop, so it pass each AD web page url to Kijiji-Scraper_s.py, and then scrape web page data then save into All_Page_Data.txt
  7)  Insert_Table.py  This is the code I wrote to upload the csv values up to google cloud table (postgres).  This is the code I wrote for the second class, so it might not work with the new csv file I generated on 4).  I will debug it when I get time.
  
  2. What I plan to do for SPRINT 3:
    1) Convert address to geocode/geotag then insert into csv file as new column;   Done by convert_geo.py
    2) More data cleaning;                                                          Done by Convert_CSV2.py
    3) Drop my old table from google cloud and then insert my new data into MYSQL table;   Done by Insert_Table.py
    4) Data analysis on Jupyter Notebook;
    5) Discuss with Matthew, see if I can merge my data with Michael's
